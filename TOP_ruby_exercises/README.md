DATA STRUCTURES - A collection more advanced exercises.

10. Linked List 
    Classes and methods to create and manage linked lists.

11. Balanced Search
    You’ll build a balanced BST in this assignment. Do not use duplicate values because they make it more complicated and result in trees that are much harder to     
    balance. Therefore, be sure to always remove duplicate values or check for an existing value before inserting.
    The Description of this project is very detailed.  Please review the specifics here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/binary-search-trees

12. Knights Travails 
    Your task is to build a function knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop 
    on along the way.   https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/knights-travails
    

Recursive exercises From The Odin Project

7a. Roman numeral exercise from same code quiz

7b. Second roman numeral exercise from same code quiz

8. Fibonacci - Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.
- Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).

9. Merge Sort - Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

This is a collection of the inital ruby exercises that I completed on The Odin Project.

1. Caesar Cipher - Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified 
string.

1a. Added RSpec Testing to Caesar Cipher

2. Sub Strings - Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid 
substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) 
that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

3. Stock Picker - Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical 
day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

4. Bubble Sort - Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort
methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn’t it?).
