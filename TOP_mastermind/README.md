Introduction
If you’ve never played Mastermind, a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs), check it out on Wikipedia. Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.

Assignment
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer’s random code.

Potential Improvements
1. Provide settings for Computer AI  easy/hard.
2. Improve game flow. Make player input Horizontal on a single line vs current 1 input per gets.
3. Add replay option with Series (multi-game) tracker.
4. Add a print funciton to print out past guesses and feedback.
