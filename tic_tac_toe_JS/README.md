Project: 

Make a Tic Tac Toe Game that is playable in the Browser.   View Assignment here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe

Notes: Made the AI a little less than unbeatable so that my daughter found it more fun.   The AI sometimes makes a mistake on the first move 

Potential improvements: 
1. Improve the draw checker to that it recognises a drawn game before all the spaces are filled
2. Improve the play of the AI when it's lost so that it plays more realisiticly. 
3. Implement difficulty levels for the AI and a selecter on the overlay page.
