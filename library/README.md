This is a project from The Odin Project. in which we build a project using javscript objects and prototypes.

I chose to not use JS classes nor to add the methods to Library prototype in order to mess around with the this statment and try to dial it in better.

I also set up the Book constructor so that it will take any number of elements so that a user can add dynamical add or remove fields to the input form and customize the data.
